# Operator-Overloading-CPP
 This C++ program demonstrates operator overloading through a Binary class. The class includes overloaded operators for arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (=,==, >, &lt;), increment (++), decrement (--), and stream operations (>>, &lt;&lt;). A menu-driven main function illustrates the use of these overloaded operators with Binary objects.
