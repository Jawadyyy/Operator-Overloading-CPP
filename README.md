## Introduction

The `Binary` class provides functionalities to perform basic arithmetic operations and comparisons on a `float` radius. It includes overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as comparison operators like equality, greater than, and less than. Additionally, it supports input and output operations using `>>` and `<<` operators.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Code:**

    Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile the code using a terminal or command prompt.

    ```bash
    g++ Operator_Overloading.cpp -o binary_operations
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**

    Execute the compiled program to see operator overloading in action.

    ```bash
    ./binary_operations
    ```

## Usage

The program prompts the user to select which operator to overload from a menu. Based on the user's choice, it demonstrates the functionality of the selected operator with predefined values or input provided by the user.

## Operators Overloaded

The following operators are overloaded in the `Binary` class:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `>>` Input
- `<<` Output
- `=` Assignment
- `==` Equality
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `++` Pre-increment
- `--` Pre-decrement
